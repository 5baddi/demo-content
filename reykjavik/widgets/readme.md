# What is this?

You are browsing the demo widgets settings files for [**Reykjavik** WordPress theme by WebManDesign.eu](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/reykjavik-wordpress-theme/).


## One-click installation

**Reykjavik** theme supports one-click demo content installation via your WordPress dashboard.

It will import all the demo widgets automatically. For more info on one-click demo installation please read [theme documentation](https://www.webmandesign.eu/manual/reykjavik/#demo-content).

*You do not need to download and install the files from this repository in that case!*


## Before you begin

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

1. Install and active the [**Reykjavik** WordPress theme](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/reykjavik-wordpress-theme/). It is also recommended to install theme demo content beforehand as it may contain additional sidebars and predefined menus.
2. Install and activate the [**Widget Importer &amp; Exporter**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.
3. We suggest you remove all the existing widgets from your widget areas (sidebars) beforehand (do this in **Appearance &raquo; Widgets** in your WordPress admin).
4. You can install [**Widget CSS Classes**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-css-classes/) plugin to allow using layout CSS classes on widgets (this widgets demo content actually includes custom CSS classes applied on some widgets).


## Installation process

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

1. Download the `.wie` file to your computer (read below for "How to download the files?")
2. Navigate to **Tools &raquo; Widget Importer & Exporter** in your WordPress admin
3. Under "Import Widgets" section click the "Choose File" button and select the downloaded `.wie` file from your computer
4. Click the **"Import Widgets"** button to import the demo website widgets settings
5. The last step is to reset the "Custom Menu" widget:  
    1. Navigate to **Appearance &raquo; Widgets**
    2. In *"Footer Widgets"* area set the "Custom Menu: Theme links" widget to display the "Theme Links" menu (you need to have this menu created or imported with theme demo content beforehand)
    3. In *"Footer Widgets"* area set the "Custom Menu: Information" widget to display the "Information" menu (you need to have this menu created or imported with theme demo content beforehand)


## Important notes

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

Please understand that due to how the WordPress works, the database IDs for imported content will differ from the actual IDs used on the theme demo website and thus you need to reset these to the correct values used in your website database (see the step 5 in "Installation process" above). This is normal in WordPress to prevent current existing content overwriting.
