# What is this?

You are browsing the demo forms files for [**Polyclinic** WordPress theme by WebMan](http://www.webmandesign.eu/polyclinic-wordpress-theme/).


## Before you begin

1. Install and active the [**Polyclinic** WordPress theme](http://www.webmandesign.eu/polyclinic-wordpress-theme/)
2. Install and activate the [**Caldera Forms**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/) plugin


## Installation process

1. Download each `.json` file to your computer (read below for "How to download the files?")
2. Navigate to **Caldera Forms &raquo; Forms** in your WordPress admin
3. Click the **"Import"** button
4. Set the new form name, choose the form file from your computer and click the **"Import Form"** button to import the demo form
5. You will need to tweak the imported forms settings to match your needs
6. Finally, as the theme provides the styles for HTML forms, we suggest to disable the Caldera Form front-end styles for these (go to **Caldera Forms &raquo; Forms**, click the "General Settings" button and disable *"Form Styles"* option)


## Important notes

Please understand that due to how the WordPress works, the database IDs for imported content will differ from the actual IDs used on the theme demo website and thus you need to reset these to the correct values used in your website database. This is normal in WordPress to prevent current existing content overwriting.

You will need to use the "Caldera Forms" widget in the page builder to display the correct form on the specific page. Please refer to the [theme's demo website](http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/polyclinic/) for the forms reference.
