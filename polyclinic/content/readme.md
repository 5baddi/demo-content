  * [Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) - page builder plugin used to build the demo content (make sure the page builder is enabled for Posts, Pages and Staff - check this under **Settings &raquo; Page Builder &raquo; Post Types**)
  * [Maps Builder - Google Maps Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-maps-builder/) - maps plugin used to build the demo content (you are free to use any maps plugin you prefer, though)

## Installation process

1. Install the demo content XML file according to [WordPress Codex instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#WordPress) (or [watch the video](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/a-beginners-guide-to-using-wordpress/lessons/wordpress-tools) on how to import WordPress XML files)
2. After the demo content is imported, set up your home and blog page under **Settings &raquo; Reading &raquo; "Front page displays"** (set "Front page" to "Homepage" and "Posts page" to "News")
