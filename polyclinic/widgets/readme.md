# What is this?

## One-click installation

**Polyclinic** theme supports one-click demo content installation via your WordPress dashboard. Once you have installed and activated demo content required plugins as listed above, refer to [theme documentation](https://www.webmandesign.eu/manual/polyclinic/#demo-content) for information on how to run the one-click demo installation process. *You do not need to download and install the files from this repository in that case!*


## Before you install

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only.*

1. Install and active the [**Polyclinic** WordPress theme](http://www.webmandesign.eu/polyclinic-wordpress-theme/)
2. Install and activate the [**Widget Importer &amp; Exporter**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin
3. We suggest you remove all the existing widgets from your widget areas (sidebars) beforehand (do this in **Appearance &raquo; Widgets** in your WordPress admin)


## Installation process

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only.*

1. Download the `.wie` file to your computer (read below for "How to download the files?")
2. Navigate to **Tools &raquo; Widget Importer & Exporter** in your WordPress admin
3. Under "Import Widgets" section click the "Choose File" button and select the downloaded `.wie` file from your computer
4. Click the **"Import Widgets"** button to import the demo website widgets settings
5. The last step is to reset the "Custom Menu" widget:
  1. Navigate to **Appearance &raquo; Widgets**
  2. In "Sidebar" area set the "Custom Menu: Socialize with us" widget to display the "Social links" menu
  3. In "Header Info Widgets" area set the "Custom Menu: Quick navigation" widget to display the "Short navigation" menu
  4. In "Header Info Widgets" area set the "Custom Menu: Find us on social networks" widget to display the "Social links" menu
  5. In "Footer Widgets" area set the "Custom Menu: Theme links" widget to display the "Footer menu" menu


## Important notes

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only.*

Please understand that due to how the WordPress works, the database IDs for imported content will differ from the actual IDs used on the theme demo website and thus you need to reset these to the correct values used in your website database (see the step 5 in "Installation process" above). This is normal in WordPress to prevent current existing content overwriting.
